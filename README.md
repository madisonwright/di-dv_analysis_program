# di-dv_analysis_program
A program to analyze di/dv peaks of data obtained from a Scanning Tunneling Microscope


The seventh cell contains the output for user interaction.  You may select between eight different graphing styles.

You may select a variety of filters to the data;
  - explosion and noise selectoins must be applied with the 'Apply Filter' button
  - select ranges can be applied with a hit of the 'Enter' key
  - The 'Reset' button removes the filters and resets the data set for your current graph style


The eighth cell contains a form for user data submission.  I have blacked out the code that completely appends the new data point to the data set as to not mess with current real data.  It is currently safe to create new points without real data.
